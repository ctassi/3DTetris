To build this project, open a new (empty) Visual Studio project, go to the Project menu, Add Existing Item, and select all the files in this folder. Copy the cube-border.bmp file to the directory by the name of your project (e.g. If your project is named TestBuild, the directory containing your project should contain a directory named TestBuild. Place the bmp file in this folder).
